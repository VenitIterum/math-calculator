# Math Calculator and Data Structure And Algorithms
An experimentation project for myself.
The project consists of two parts.
- The first part is developing an advanced mathematical calculator. And there are plans to add calculation of integrals, derivatives, etc.
- The second part contains classes for working with data structures and algorithms. Sorting, binary operations, lists, trees, etc.
